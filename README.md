* [Making Modern
  Toughness](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/opinion/making-modern-toughness.html?nytmobile=0&_r=0):
I liked the bit about 'strong like water.'
* [Redux binding for Vue](https://github.com/revue/revue): This week I'm staying at a hostel in Austin, TX. I was sitting in the kitchen reading up on some of the updates to Vue when someone asked, "Is that github...?" We shot the shit for a while. He told me he is working at a nonprofit in San Diego who has selected Vue as their platform. I did a little research on state management in Vue. Small world out there.
