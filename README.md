* [Redux binding for Vue](https://github.com/revue/revue)
  * This week I'm staying at a hostel in Austin, TX. I was sitting in the kitchen reading up on some of the updates to Vue when someone asked, "Is that github...?" We shot the shit for a while. He told me he is working at a nonprofit in San Diego who has selected Vue as their platform. I did a little research on state management in Vue. Small world out there.
